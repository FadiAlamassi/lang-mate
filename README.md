## **Set up the app locally :**

- Clone this repo: 
    ```javascript
    git clone https://github.com/FadiAlamassi/lang-mate.git
    ```
- Run in the terminal **npm run project-i** to install the packages that requried for the app.
- **Database Setup**:
  
    In terminal type psql or pgcli if installed. Within psql/pcli enter the following commands:
  ```javascript 
  CREATE DATABASE [db_name];  
  CREATE USER [user_name] WITH PASSWORD ['password'];
  ```
  **Now you should create another database for the test**


   Next initialize the databases using dbbuild.sql file in pgcli run :

   ```javascript 
   pgcli postgres://[user_name]:[password]@localhost:5432/[db_name]
   \i <path_to_dbbuild.sql>
   ```

## **Environment Variables :**

   Now you should create file config.env in the root folder, then set the database url in your config.env as follows (setting the values in square brackets to the values you defined in the steps above):

   ```javascript 
   DEV_DB_URL=postgres://[user_name]:[password]@localhost:5432/[db_name]
   TEST_DB_URL=postgres://[test_user_name]:[password]@localhost:5432/[test_db_name]
   ```

   Now you should set secret key inside the file:
  ```javascript
  KEY=[your-secret-key]
  ```
   Now you should have the following in config.env file:

```javascript
DEV_DB_URL
TEST_DB_URL
KEY
```
  ## **Start the app :**
  In your terminal write:

  ```javascript
  npm run dev
  ```
  then the app will open automatically in the browser after few seconds on [localhost]('http://localhost:3000')
